One day, the princess of Hyrule and her companions came to see the Guardian and its army of mechanical puppets. The princess of Hyrule was curious about the Guardian and approached it. The Guardian's judgment detected an unknown threat posed by the princess, and it responded. The princess of Hyrule was shown no mercy and thus fell to the ground. Hashtag YOLO.",
